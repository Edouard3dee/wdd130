        <h1>Peter Edouard| WDD 130</h1>
        <p>My name is Peter Edouard i'm from domincan republic. I like to Dance, I like to listen podcast, play
            basketball and like to be part of every activity of the chucrch. And again, we saw the terrestrial world,
            and behold and lo, these are they who are of the terrestrial, whose glory
            differs from that of the church of the Firstborn who have received the fulness of the Father, even as that
            of the moon
            differs from the sun in the firmament.
            Behold, these are they who died without law;
            And also they who are the spirits of men kept in prison, whom the Son visited, and preached the gospel unto
            them,
            that they might be judged according to men in the flesh;
            Who received not the testimony of Jesus in the flesh, but afterwards received it.
